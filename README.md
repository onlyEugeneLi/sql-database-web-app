# Accessing Online Database via a Web App

I want to create an online relational data storage solution and want it to be accessible via a Web App. First, I created an Azure SQL Database and populated it with some product pricing data. I ensured that the Azure SQL Database is secure using SQL authentication. Then I can connect to it using Visual Studio Code's SQL Server extension.

After that, create a simple Web App in Python that will return the price of any product based on the product ID. Ensure that it can connect to the Azure SQL Database and that it can run queries on it. Deploy the App to the cloud using Azure Web Apps.

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of what Iâ€™ve done:

âœ… Built a web API to handle user requests.

âœ… Set up an Azure database to store user inputs and other relevant data.

âœ… Created a web app interface for users to interact with the system.
